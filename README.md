# pyopensim
Portable python bindings for OpenSim with type hints

## Key Features
- **Portable**: Self-contained Python wheels with bundled OpenSim libraries
- **Type Hints**: Inline `.pyi` stub files for type checking and IDE support
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **OpenSim's Native SWIG Bindings**: Uses OpenSim's official SWIG bindings for consistency


## Development

This project builds OpenSim from source to create self-contained Python wheels. The build process includes compiling OpenSim's C++ libraries and generating SWIG Python bindings.
